# CConductor

> CConductor is a multi-agent AI research system that conducts comprehensive, adaptive research on any topic. Powered by Claude Code and specialized AI agents, it orchestrates research across academic papers, web sources, PDFs, and code repositoriesâ€”delivering well-cited, validated research reports with quality scoring.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents (research planner, web researcher, academic researcher, PDF analyzer, market analyzer, synthesis agent, fact checker) work in parallel
- **Adaptive Research**: Dynamic task generation that identifies gaps, resolves contradictions, and explores leads until high confidence is achieved
- **Quality Validation**: Automatic confidence scoring (0-100), citation tracking, contradiction detection, and gap coverage analysis
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Academic databases (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PubMed), web content, local PDFs, markdown files, and code repositories
- **Extensible Knowledge**: Custom domain expertise via markdown files without code modification
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL/Git Bash)

**Important Notes:**

- CConductor requires Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) - it cannot run standalone with just an API key
- Built with Bash 4.0+, uses jq for JSON processing, curl for HTTP requests, and bc for accurate calculations
- Version 0.1.1 (Beta Release) - Production-ready with all core infrastructure operational
- Research sessions typically take 5-40 minutes depending on complexity and depth
