# CConductor

> CConductor is a multi-agent AI research system that conducts comprehensive, adaptive research on any topic. Powered by Claude Code and specialized AI agents, it uses mission-based orchestration to dynamically plan and execute research across academic papers, web sources, PDFs, and code repositoriesâ€”delivering well-cited, validated research reports with quality scoring.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Mission-Based Orchestration**: Autonomous research coordination with four mission types (academic-research, market-research, competitive-analysis, technical-analysis)
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents dynamically selected based on research needs and capabilities
- **Interactive Mode**: Dialog-based TUI for guided research setup and session management
- **Adaptive Research**: Dynamic agent selection, budget tracking, and strategy adaptation based on findings
- **Quality Validation**: Automatic confidence scoring (0-100), citation tracking, contradiction detection, and quality gate diagnostics with automated remediation
- **Evidence Artifacts**: Paragraph-level citations with source deep links and comprehensive evidence tracking
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Academic databases (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PubMed), web content, local PDFs, markdown files, and code repositories
- **Cache-Aware Research**: Intelligent web content caching with fine-grained control (--no-cache, --no-web-fetch-cache, --no-web-search-cache)
- **Enhanced Observability**: Real-time progress updates, agent reasoning visibility, and comprehensive decision logging
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL/Git Bash)

**Important Notes:**

- CConductor requires Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) - it cannot run standalone with just an API key
- Built with Bash 4.0+, uses jq for JSON processing, curl for HTTP requests, and bc for accurate calculations
- Research sessions typically take 5-40 minutes depending on complexity and depth
