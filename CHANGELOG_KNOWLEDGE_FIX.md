# Knowledge Injection Fix - October 2024

## Summary

Fixed the knowledge injection system that existed but was never actually called. The system now properly injects domain-specific knowledge from `knowledge-base/` and `knowledge-base-custom/` into agent prompts.

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. `src/utils/build-agents.sh` - Added knowledge injection call
2. `src/utils/knowledge-loader.sh` - Fixed arithmetic bug
3. `src/cconductor-adaptive.sh` - Pass session_dir to build-agents.sh

### Documentation
4. `internal_docs/KNOWLEDGE_INJECTION_FIX.md` - Detailed fix documentation (NEW)
5. `internal_docs/SELF_DESCRIBING_AGENTS.md` - Updated Phase 1 status
6. `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Added Knowledge Injection System section
7. `docs/KNOWLEDGE_EXTENSION.md` - Added status and how-it-works

## What Was Fixed

### Before
- ❌ `inject_knowledge_context()` existed but was never called
- ❌ Custom knowledge in `knowledge-base-custom/` had no effect
- ❌ Session-specific knowledge overrides didn't work
- ❌ Documentation promised features that didn't work

### After
- ✅ Knowledge injection fully operational
- ✅ Custom knowledge properly loaded
- ✅ Session-specific overrides supported
- ✅ Priority system (session > custom > core) functional

## Testing

Verified that custom knowledge is properly injected into agent prompts.

## Impact

- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes
- **Fully Functional**: Knowledge system now works as documented
- **Ready to Use**: Can immediately add custom knowledge

## Next Steps

See `internal_docs/SELF_DESCRIBING_AGENTS.md` for the full plan to make agents self-describing (Phase 2+).
