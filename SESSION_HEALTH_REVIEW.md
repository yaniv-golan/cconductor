# Session Health Review: session_1759842915552654000

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Session Status**: Active  
**Review Requested**: Why citations show 0 + overall correctness  

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Session has **zero citations** despite having 16 entities and 20 claims in the knowledge graph. Root cause identified: **Agent findings format does not include sources, and coordinator is not extracting them**.

### Key Issues Found

1. ❌ **CRITICAL**: Zero citations - sources not being extracted or stored
2. ⚠️ **WARNING**: Agent findings aggregated into summary format, losing structured data
3. ⚠️ **WARNING**: Empty academic-researcher-output.json file
4. ✅ **GOOD**: Knowledge graph has entities (16) and claims (20)
5. ✅ **GOOD**: Task completion working (15 of 20 tasks completed)

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Citations Issue (CRITICAL)

**Observation**:
```json
{
  "total_entities": 16,
  "total_claims": 20,
  "total_citations": 0  // ❌ ZERO
}
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:

#### Step 1: Check Knowledge Graph
- Claims have `"sources": null` ❌
- Entities have `"sources": null` ❌
- Citations array exists but is empty: `[]` ❌

#### Step 2: Check Coordinator Output
Coordinator's `knowledge_graph_updates`:
- Claims: `"sources": null` ❌
- Entities: `"sources": null` ❌

**Conclusion**: Coordinator is generating entities/claims WITHOUT sources.

#### Step 3: Check Coordinator Input
Agent findings structure:
```json
{
  "new_findings": [{
    "findings_summary": {
      "t0": {
        "query": "...",
        "key_finding": "...",
        "evidence_strength": "...",
        "gap": "..."
      },
      "t1": { ... },
      ...
    },
    "status": "completed",
    "tasks_completed": 14,
    "overall_assessment": "..."
  }]
}
```

**Problem**: Findings are in **summary format**, not the structured format with:
- `entities_discovered` (with sources)
- `claims` (with sources)
- Detailed citation information

This is an **aggregated summary**, not raw structured findings!

---

### 2. Agent Output File Issue

**Observation**:
```bash
$ wc -l research-sessions/session_1759842915552654000/raw/academic-researcher-output.json
       0  # File is EMPTY
```

**Implications**:
- Raw agent output not preserved
- Cannot verify what the agent actually returned
- Cannot debug citation extraction issues

**Likely Cause**: This session ran before file-based output was implemented, and used inline output that wasn't saved to the raw file.

---

### 3. Data Flow Analysis

#### Current Flow (BROKEN for citations):

```
Academic Researcher
  ↓ (produces findings with entities_discovered[], claims[], sources[])
  ↓
Aggregation Step (PROBLEM!)
  ↓ (converts to key_finding summary format)
  ↓ (LOSES entities_discovered, claims, sources arrays)
  ↓
Coordinator Input (new_findings)
  ↓ (receives only summarized key_finding, no sources)
  ↓
Coordinator Output (knowledge_graph_updates)
  ↓ (generates entities/claims with sources: null)
  ↓
Knowledge Graph Update (kg_bulk_update)
  ↓ (adds entities/claims with null sources)
  ↓
Knowledge Graph
  ✗ (citations remain empty)
```

#### Expected Flow (CORRECT):

```
Academic Researcher
  ↓ (produces findings with entities_discovered[], claims[], sources[])
  ↓
Coordinator Input (new_findings)
  ↓ (receives FULL structured findings with sources)
  ↓
Coordinator Output (knowledge_graph_updates)
  ↓ (generates entities/claims with sources arrays)
  ↓
Knowledge Graph Update (kg_bulk_update)
  ↓ (extracts sources from entities/claims)
  ↓ (adds to top-level citations[] array)
  ↓
Knowledge Graph
  ✓ (citations populated)
```

### 4. Task Completion Status

**Good News**: Task execution working well

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total tasks | 20 | ✅ |
| Completed | 15 | ✅ 75% |
| In progress | 5 | ⚠️ Currently running |
| Pending | 0 | ✅ |
| Failed | 0 | ✅ |

**Tasks completed successfully**:
- t0-t14 (15 foundational tasks)
- All completed by `academic-researcher`

**Tasks in progress**:
- t15-t19 (5 tasks)
- Currently running on `web-researcher` and `academic-researcher`

---

### 5. Knowledge Graph Structure

**Current State**:

| Component | Count | Quality |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Entities | 16 | ✅ Good |
| Claims | 20 | ✅ Good |
| Relationships | 15 | ✅ Good |
| **Citations** | **0** | ❌ **BROKEN** |
| Gaps | 12 | ✅ Good |
| Contradictions | 1 | ✅ Good |
| Leads | 9 | ✅ Good |

**Entities include**:
- Mitochondrial Function
- Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)
- Critical Slowing Down
- Exercise Interventions
- Ketogenic Diet
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- Oxidative Stress
- Digital Phenotyping
- Epigenetic Differences
- Attractor States
- etc.

**Claims include**:
- "Mitochondrial markers distinguish SSRI responders..."
- "NO direct head-to-head comparison exists between metabolic markers and polygenic risk scores..."
- "Critical slowing down predicted depression transitions..."
- etc.

**All have `sources: null`** ❌

---

### 6. Coordinator Analysis

**Coordinator is functioning** but generating updates without sources:

```json
{
  "knowledge_graph_updates": {
    "entities_discovered": [
      {
        "name": "Mitochondrial Function",
        "type": "biomarker_category",
        "description": "...",
        "confidence": 0.80,
        "sources": null  // ❌ Should have sources
      }
    ],
    "claims": [
      {
        "statement": "...",
        "confidence": 0.80,
        "sources": null  // ❌ Should have sources
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why?** Because the coordinator's input (`new_findings`) doesn't include structured entities/claims with sources - only summarized text.

---

## Root Cause Summary

### The Problem

**Agent findings are being aggregated/summarized BEFORE being passed to the coordinator**, losing all structured citation data.

### Where This Happens

Looking at the coordinator input structure, the `new_findings` array contains:
```json
{
  "findings_summary": {
    "t0": {
      "query": "...",
      "key_finding": "...",  // ← Text summary, no structure
      "evidence_strength": "...",
      "gap": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

This is NOT the raw agent output format, which should be:
```json
{
  "task_id": "t0",
  "query": "...",
  "entities_discovered": [{...}],  // ← Structured with sources
  "claims": [{...}],               // ← Structured with sources
  "sources": [{...}]               // ← Citation information
}
```

### Likely Culprit

There's likely a **multi-task aggregation step** that:
1. Takes individual task findings from academic-researcher
2. Aggregates them into a summary object
3. Loses the structured entities/claims/sources arrays
4. Passes only text summaries to coordinator

This aggregation may be happening in:
- `src/cconductor-adaptive.sh` in the agent results processing
- Or in a multi-task response handler

## Impact Assessment

### Data Quality

| Aspect | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Entities** | ✅ Good | Extracted and structured |
| **Claims** | ✅ Good | Extracted and structured |
| **Relationships** | ✅ Good | Extracted and linked |
| **Sources/Citations** | ❌ **MISSING** | **Cannot verify any claims** |
| **Confidence scores** | ⚠️ Questionable | Without sources, cannot validate |
| **Evidence strength** | ⚠️ Questionable | Without sources, cannot verify |

### Research Integrity

❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Without citations:
- Cannot verify any claim
- Cannot assess evidence quality
- Cannot trace findings back to literature
- Research is not reproducible
- No way to check for accuracy

This is a **fundamental research integrity issue**.

---

## Comparison to Bug Fix We Implemented

### What We Just Fixed

✅ Successfully fixed multi-task processing for `academic-researcher` and `web-researcher`:
- File-based output to handle 100+ tasks
- Proper extraction of findings arrays
- **Structured entities/claims/sources preservation**

### What This Session Is Missing

❌ This session appears to have run with:
- An older version of multi-task handling
- Aggregation logic that loses structure
- No file-based output preservation

### Evidence

1. Empty `academic-researcher-output.json` file
2. Findings in summarized key_finding format
3. No sources in any entities or claims
4. Session created at 13:15:17 (before our latest fixes)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Stop relying on this session's research** until citations are fixed
2. **Investigate the aggregation code** that's creating the findings_summary format
3. **Verify current code** handles sources properly in new sessions

### Code Investigation Needed

Look for code that:
1. Takes array of findings from agents
2. Aggregates them into a summary object
3. Converts structured data to text summaries
4. **This is where sources are being lost**

Likely locations:
- `src/cconductor-adaptive.sh` line ~700-800 (agent results processing)
- Multi-task response aggregation logic

### Testing Required

1. Start a new session with current code
2. Verify findings include sources
3. Verify coordinator receives structured findings
4. Verify citations are extracted and stored

## Session Timeline

```
13:15:17 - Session created
13:15:46 - Research planner completed
13:15:51 - Academic researcher started (15 tasks)
13:21:36 - Academic researcher completed
13:21:37 - Coordinator started (iteration 1)
13:23:25 - Coordinator completed
13:23:26 - System observations logged (empty graph)
13:23:27 - Iteration 2 started
13:29:51 - Web researcher completed (tasks)
13:32:30 - Academic researcher completed (more tasks)
```

**Current**: Still running (iteration 2, 5 tasks in progress)

| **Citation Extraction** | ❌ **BROKEN** | **F** |
| **Source Attribution** | ❌ **BROKEN** | **F** |
| Gap Detection | ✅ Working | A |
| Contradiction Detection | ✅ Working | A |
| Lead Identification | ✅ Working | A |
| Dashboard Display | ✅ Fixed | A |
| Observation Resolution | ✅ Fixed | A |

**Overall Grade**: **C-** (would be A if citations worked)

---

## Conclusion

### What's Working

✅ Task execution and completion  
✅ Knowledge graph population  
✅ Entity and claim extraction  
✅ Relationship mapping  
✅ Gap and contradiction detection  
✅ Dashboard display (after our fix)  
✅ Observation resolution (after our fix)  

### What's Broken

❌ **CRITICAL**: Citation extraction and storage  
❌ **CRITICAL**: Source attribution for all entities and claims  
❌ Agent output file preservation  

### Root Cause

**Findings aggregation layer** is converting structured agent output (with entities, claims, sources) into text summaries (key_finding format), losing all citation data before it reaches the coordinator.

### Next Steps

1. **Investigate aggregation code** in `cconductor-adaptive.sh`
2. **Find where findings_summary format is created**
3. **Fix to preserve structured findings with sources**
4. **Test with new session**
5. **Update existing sessions** if possible

**PRIORITY**: HIGH - This is a fundamental research integrity issue.
