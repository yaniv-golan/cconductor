## Agent Details

### Prompt Parser
- **Role**: Reads the raw `user-prompt.txt`, extracts the objective that research agents should pursue, and captures any formatting or stylistic instructions separately.
- **Inputs**: `user-prompt.txt` generated by the CLI or TUI.
- **Outputs**: JSON containing `objective`, `output_specification`, and `research_question`, which feeds the planner and any downstream formatting requirements.
- **Why it matters**: Keeps research agents focused on substance while preserving presentation guidance for the synthesis stage.
- **Deeper docs**: [System prompt](../src/claude-runtime/agents/prompt-parser/system-prompt.md), [Custom output formatting walkthrough](USER_GUIDE.md#custom-output-formatting)

### Research Planner
- **Role**: Understands the cleaned objective, clarifies mode-specific rules (interactive vs automated), and emits an initial queue of tasks categorized by agent capability.
- **Inputs**: Mission request plus orchestrator metadata (including `mode`).
- **Outputs**: Structured task JSON with priorities and recommended agent types.
- **Why it matters**: Gives the Mission Orchestrator a starting roadmap so the mission can ramp quickly without missing obvious sub-questions.

### Mission Orchestrator
- **Role**: Central coordinator that invokes agents, evaluates their outputs, updates the knowledge graph, and adapts strategy until mission goals are met.
- **Inputs**: Mission profile, planner tasks, session metadata, domain heuristics, knowledge graph state, and cost/budget telemetry.
- **Outputs**: Agent invocation schedules, log events, updated knowledge graph entries, and completion decisions.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures missions remain adaptive—balancing coverage, recency, budget, and stakeholder requirements.

### Domain Heuristics
- **Role**: Performs a quick reconnaissance pass to map the mission’s domain, identify critical stakeholder categories, set freshness thresholds, and list must-cover watch items.
- **Inputs**: Mission objective and profile snapshot.
- **Outputs**: `artifacts/domain-heuristics/domain-heuristics.json` (copied into `meta/domain-heuristics.json`) plus a lock file for progress tracking.
- **Why it matters**: Drives domain-aware quality gates, ensuring reports include balanced perspectives and recent, critical information.

### Stakeholder Classifier
- **Role**: Consumes mission policies/resolvers and the latest knowledge graph sources, classifying each source into the mission-defined stakeholder vocabulary. Escalates ambiguous cases to Claude and records alias suggestions for future resolver promotion.
- **Inputs**: `meta/stakeholder-policy.json`, `meta/stakeholder-resolver.json`, and the knowledge graph citations for the current session.
- **Outputs**: `session/stakeholder-classifications.jsonl`, LLM invocation budgets, alias suggestions, and status updates used by the stakeholder gate.
- **Why it matters**: Guarantees the quality gate can make deterministic pass/fail decisions on stakeholder coverage without modifying the knowledge graph mid-mission.

- **Inputs**: Arrays of research tasks with queries, context, and expectations supplied by the orchestrator.
- **Outputs**: `work/web-researcher/findings-<task>.json` files plus a manifest referencing each finding; the orchestration layer merges the findings automatically.
- **Why it matters**: Provides broad coverage across news, industry, and authoritative sources while respecting tool and cache restrictions.
