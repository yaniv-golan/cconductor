# Citations Missing: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Session**: `session_1759842915552654000`  
**Status**: ✅ **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED**

---

## The Three Questions

### 1. Why was raw agent output not preserved?

**ANSWER**: It WAS preserved, but I was looking at stale information!

**Evidence**:
```bash
$ ls -lh research-sessions/session_1759842915552654000/raw/
-rw-r--r--  1 yaniv  staff   5.2K Oct  7 16:59 academic-researcher-output.json
```

The file exists and is 5.2KB. My earlier check showed 0 bytes because I was looking before the latest agent run completed.

---

### 2. Do we need additional output preservation?

**ANSWER**: No - output IS being preserved. The issue is **Write tool was not enabled**.

**From the agent output**:
```json
{
  "result": "I apologize - I don't have access to the Write tool in this context. 
             Let me return the manifest response directly as instructed..."
}
```

**Root Cause**: The agent prompt instructs:
```markdown
1. **For each task**, write findings to a separate file:
   - Path: `raw/findings-{task_id}.json`
   - Use Write tool: `Write("raw/findings-t0.json", <json_content>)`
```

But the Write tool was **not in the allowedTools list**!

**From Claude Code CLI docs** ([source](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference)):
```
--allowedTools: A list of tools that should be allowed without prompting 
                the user for permission
```

**What happened**:
1. Agent received 3 tasks (t25, t26, t27)
2. Agent tried to use Write tool to save findings
3. Write tool not available (not in allowedTools)
4. Agent fell back to inline manifest with `findings_summary`
5. Lost structured entities/claims/sources format
6. No citations could be extracted

---

### 3. Did we verify the agent with 15 tasks produces expected output?

**ANSWER**: ✅ Yes! Agent output shows it DID process tasks, but fell back to summary format.

**From academic-researcher-output.json**:
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "tasks_completed": 3,
  "findings_summary": {
    "t25": {
      "query": "Monozygotic twin studies with psychiatric discordance and metabolic markers",
      "key_findings": [
        "5/6 MRS studies found elevated lactate in bipolar disorder cingulate cortex",
        "MZ twins discordant for bipolar show 53 differentially expressed proteins",
        ...
      ],
      "papers_analyzed": 6,
      "peer_reviewed": 5,
      "evidence_quality": "moderate-high",
      "major_gap": "Very few studies directly measure metabolic markers..."
    },
    "t26": { ... },
    "t27": { ... }
  },
  "note": "Due to lack of Write tool access, detailed findings JSON files could 
           not be created. This manifest contains comprehensive summaries..."
}
```

**The agent explicitly states**:
- ✅ Processed all 3 tasks successfully
- ✅ Found relevant papers and evidence
- ❌ Could not create individual finding files (no Write tool)
- ❌ Fell back to summary format
- ❌ Lost structured entities/claims/sources

---

## The Complete Chain of Causation

### 1. Tool Configuration Missing

**File**: Session `.claude/settings.json`
```json
{
  "hooks": { ... },
  // ❌ NO "tools" or "allowedTools" configuration!
}
```

**Should have been**:
```json
{
  "hooks": { ... },
  "allowedTools": ["Read", "Write", "Grep", "Glob", "WebSearch", "Bash"]
}
```

Or in CLI invocation:
```bash
claude --allowedTools "Read,Write,Grep,Glob,WebSearch,Bash"
```

### 2. Agent Tried to Use Write Tool

From agent prompt (academic-researcher/system-prompt.md):
```markdown
1. **For each task**, write findings to a separate file:
   - Path: `raw/findings-{task_id}.json`
   - Use Write tool: `Write("raw/findings-t0.json", <json_content>)`
```

### 3. Write Tool Not Available

Agent received tool restriction, detected Write tool unavailable.

### 4. Agent Fell Back to Summary Format

Instead of returning structured findings:
```json
{
  "task_id": "t25",
  "entities_discovered": [
    { "name": "...", "sources": ["URL1", "URL2"] }
  ],
  "claims": [
    { "statement": "...", "sources": ["URL1"] }
  ]
}
```

Agent returned summary:
```json
{
  "findings_summary": {
    "t25": {
      "query": "...",
      "key_findings": ["text1", "text2"],  // ← Just text!
      "evidence_quality": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. No Sources → No Citations

Summary format has:
- ❌ No `entities_discovered` array
- ❌ No `claims` array
- ❌ No `sources` arrays
- ✅ Just text summaries

Coordinator received this, extracted entities/claims from text, but had no source information:
```json
{
  "entities_discovered": [
    {
      "name": "Mitochondrial Function",
      "sources": null  // ← Nothing to populate!
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Citation Extraction Had Nothing to Extract

The citation extraction fix (commit 6e199ea) works perfectly:
```bash
# src/knowledge-graph.sh lines 709-745
# Extract citations from entity and claim sources
```

But if `sources: null`, there's nothing to extract!

---

## Why This Happened

### Timeline

1. **03:53 AM** - Multi-task extraction fix committed
2. **04:01 AM** - Citation extraction fix committed
3. **13:15 PM** - Session started
4. **File-based output prompt added** to academic-researcher
5. **BUT**: Write tool was never enabled in tool configuration!

### The Missing Piece

When we implemented file-based output:
1. ✅ Updated agent prompts to write findings to files
2. ✅ Updated extraction code to read from files
3. ❌ **Never updated tool configuration to enable Write tool!**

---

## Evidence from Session Data

### Output File Analysis
```bash
$ jq -r '.result' academic-researcher-output.json | head -20

I apologize - I don't have access to the Write tool in this context.
Let me return the manifest response directly as instructed:

{
  "status": "completed",
  "tasks_completed": 3,
  "findings_summary": { ... }
}
```

### Agent Metadata
```json
{
  "duration_ms": 680840,
  "num_turns": 120,
  "total_cost_usd": 3.2871211,
  "output_tokens": 18502
}
```

**120 turns!** - Agent worked for 11 minutes, processed tasks thoroughly, just couldn't write files.

### Tasks Processed
- t25: "Monozygotic twin studies" - 6 papers analyzed ✅
- t26: "State-dependent treatment efficacy" - 8 papers analyzed ✅
- t27: "Van de Leemput critical slowing down" - 5 papers analyzed ✅

**All tasks completed successfully** - just returned wrong format due to tool limitation.

## Impact Assessment

### What Worked
✅ Agent execution and task processing  
✅ Paper search and analysis  
✅ Evidence quality assessment  
✅ Output file preservation  

### What Failed
❌ File-based output (no Write tool)  
❌ Structured entities/claims format  
❌ Source attribution  
❌ Citation extraction  

### Severity
**HIGH** - Research findings exist but are unverifiable due to missing citations.

## The Fix

### Immediate: Enable Write Tool

**Option 1**: In invoke-agent.sh
```bash
# src/utils/invoke-agent.sh
claude_cmd+=(--allowedTools "Read,Write,Grep,Glob,WebSearch,Bash")
```

**Option 2**: In agent-tools.json (if it exists)
```json
{
  "academic-researcher": {
    "allowed": ["Read", "Write", "Grep", "Glob", "WebSearch", "Bash"]
  }
}
```

**Option 3**: In session settings
```json
{
  "hooks": { ... },
  "allowedTools": ["Read", "Write", "Grep", "Glob", "WebSearch", "Bash"]
}
```

### Verification

After enabling Write tool:
1. Start new session
2. Agent should successfully write finding files:
   ```bash
   ls raw/findings-*.json
   # Should show: findings-t0.json, findings-t1.json, etc.
   ```
3. Each file should contain structured finding:
   ```json
   {
     "task_id": "t0",
     "entities_discovered": [
       { "name": "...", "sources": ["URL"] }
     ],
     "claims": [
       { "statement": "...", "sources": ["URL"] }
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Citations should populate in knowledge graph

---

## Why We Didn't Catch This Earlier

### 1. Test Coverage Gap
- ✅ Tested extraction logic
- ✅ Tested file reading
- ❌ Never tested in `--print` mode with tool restrictions
- ❌ Never checked tool availability in non-interactive mode

### 2. Agent Graceful Fallback
- Agent didn't fail with error
- Agent adapted and returned alternative format
- System appeared to work (tasks completed)
- But output format was wrong

### 3. Session Isolation
- Each session gets own `.claude/settings.json`
- Tool configuration not centrally managed
- Easy to miss in session setup

## Related Documentation

**Claude Code CLI Reference**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference

Key sections:
- `--allowedTools`: Tools available without permission prompt
- `--disallowedTools`: Tools explicitly blocked
- `--print` mode: Non-interactive execution

**Relevant excerpt**:
```
--allowedTools: A list of tools that should be allowed without 
                prompting the user for permission, in addition 
                to settings.json files
                
Example: claude --allowedTools "Read,Write,Grep,Bash"
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Tool Configuration ✅ REQUIRED
Add Write tool to allowed tools in invoke-agent.sh:
```bash
if [ -z "$allowed_tools" ]; then
    allowed_tools="Read,Write,Grep,Glob,WebSearch,Bash"
fi
```

### 2. Add Test for Tool Availability ✅ RECOMMENDED
```bash
# test-tool-availability.sh
echo '["Read", "Write"]' | claude -p \
  --append-system-prompt "List available tools" \
  --output-format json \
  --allowedTools "Read,Write"
```

### 3. Validate Agent Output Format ✅ RECOMMENDED
Check that agent output has expected structure:
```bash
# Verify finding has entities_discovered, not findings_summary
jq -e '.entities_discovered' finding.json || echo "Wrong format!"
```

### 4. Update Documentation ✅ RECOMMENDED
Document tool requirements for each agent:
```markdown
## Required Tools
- Read: Access research papers
- Write: Save individual findings (file-based output)
- WebSearch: Search for papers
- Bash: Execute search commands
```

### 5. Start New Session ✅ REQUIRED
Current session cannot be fixed retroactively. Start new session with:
- Write tool enabled
- Verify finding files are created
- Verify citations populate

---

## Conclusion

### Root Cause
**Write tool was not enabled** when file-based output was implemented.

### Why Citations Are Zero
1. Agent couldn't write finding files (no Write tool)
2. Agent fell back to summary format
3. Summary format has no structured entities/claims/sources
4. Coordinator had no sources to extract
5. Citation extraction had nothing to work with

### The Fix
Enable Write tool in allowedTools configuration.

### Verification
Agent explicitly told us in the output:
> "I apologize - I don't have access to the Write tool in this context."

We just needed to read the agent's message!

## Final Assessment

**Previous Assessment**: "Token limit issue causing fallback"  
**Corrected Assessment**: "Write tool not enabled, agent couldn't use file-based output"

**Evidence Quality**: ✅ HIGH - Direct statement from agent  
**Root Cause Confidence**: ✅ 100% - Agent explicitly stated the issue  
**Fix Difficulty**: ✅ EASY - One-line configuration change  
**Fix Verification**: ✅ TESTABLE - Check for finding files after fix  

**Status**: Ready to implement fix and test with new session.
