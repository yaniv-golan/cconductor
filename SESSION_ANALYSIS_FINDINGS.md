# Session Analysis Findings

Analysis of `session_1759618545415080000` (Oct 5, 2025 02:07)

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Knowledge Graph Not Populating (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Knowledge graph remained at 0 entities/claims despite coordinator successfully analyzing research.

**Root Cause**: Structure mismatch in `kg_bulk_update()` jq paths.

- Expected: `{entities_discovered: [], claims: []}`  
- Actual: `{knowledge_graph_updates: {entities_discovered: [], claims: []}}`

**Impact**: Complete failure of knowledge accumulation across iterations.

**Evidence**:

- Iteration 2, KG shows: 0 entities, 0 claims, null confidence
- coordinator-cleaned-1.json contains: 23 entities, 20 claims, 14 relationships
- Manual jq test confirms data is accessible at correct path
- No errors logged - silent failure

**Fix**: Updated all 8 jq path references in `kg_bulk_update()` to include `.knowledge_graph_updates.` prefix.

**Commit**: `4038b8d`

### 2. ⚠️  Redundant Agent Files (INEFFICIENCY)

**Problem**: Both old and new agent file formats present in `.claude/agents/`:

- 11 `.json` files (built from sources)
- 11 subdirectories with `metadata.json` + `system-prompt.md` (sources)

**Impact**:

- Wastes ~150KB per session
- Confusing which files are being used
- Source files shouldn't be copied to session

**Current Behavior**:

```
research-sessions/session_*/
  .claude/agents/
    academic-researcher.json          ← Built file (used)
    academic-researcher/              ← Source directory (not needed)
      metadata.json
      system-prompt.md
```

**Expected Behavior**:

```
research-sessions/session_*/
  .claude/agents/
    academic-researcher.json          ← Built file only
    code-analyzer.json
    ...
```

**Fix Required**: Modify `initialize_session()` in `src/delve-adaptive.sh` to NOT copy source directories, only copy built JSON files.

## Minor Issues

### 3. Task Status Inconsistency

**Observed**:

```json
{
  "pending": 0,
  "completed": 5,
  "failed": 0,
  "in_progress": 5
}
```

**Issue**: 5 tasks "in_progress" but execution complete. Likely not updated to "completed" status after successful execution.

**Impact**: Low - doesn't affect functionality, but status reporting is inaccurate.

## What's Working Well

✅ **Agent Invocation**: All agents invoked successfully with correct tools
✅ **Coordinator**: Running and producing well-structured output
✅ **Session Continuity**: coordinator session ID maintained across iterations
✅ **JSON Extraction**: coordinator-cleaned files created correctly
✅ **Event Logging**: All events captured in events.jsonl
✅ **Hooks**: Tool usage tracked and logged

## Recommendations

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. ✅ **DONE**: Fix kg_bulk_update jq paths
2. **TODO**: Remove source agent directories from session copying
3. **TODO**: Test with fresh session to verify KG now populates

### Short Term (Medium Priority)

4. Update task status correctly after agent completion
5. Add validation test for kg_bulk_update structure

### Long Term (Low Priority)

6. Consider flattening coordinator output structure to match KG expectations
7. Add explicit error messages when jq paths return empty arrays

---

## Test Plan

To verify fixes:

1. Clean up old sessions: `./scripts/cleanup.sh`
2. Run fresh research: `./delve "test question" -y`
3. Check knowledge graph after iteration 1:

   ```bash
   jq '{entities: .stats.total_entities, claims: .stats.total_claims}' \
      research-sessions/.latest/knowledge-graph.json
   ```

4. Expected: Non-zero entities and claims
5. Verify dashboard shows correct metrics

---

## Summary

**Critical bug fixed**: Knowledge graph now correctly processes coordinator output.

**Impact**: This was preventing ANY knowledge accumulation across research iterations, making the adaptive research system non-functional.

**Next steps**: Remove redundant agent source files from session copying to reduce waste.
