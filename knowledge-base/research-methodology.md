# Research Methodology Guide

## Question Decomposition

### Breaking Down Research Questions

When analyzing a research question, decompose it into:

1. **Core Entities**: What are the main subjects/topics?
2. **Relationships**: How do these entities relate?
3. **Context**: What domain/field is this in?
4. **Scope**: What boundaries exist (time, geography, scale)?
5. **Depth**: How detailed should the answer be?

### Example Decomposition

**Question**: "How does Rust's ownership system prevent memory leaks?"

**Decomposition**:
- Core entities: Rust, ownership system, memory leaks
- Relationships: prevention mechanism
- Context: Programming languages, systems programming
- Scope: Rust language specifically (not general memory management)
- Depth: Mechanism explanation with examples

## Search Strategies

### Progressive Search Refinement

1. **Broad Search First**
   - Start with general terms
   - Understand landscape
   - Identify authoritative sources

2. **Targeted Deep Dives**
   - Follow citations from authoritative sources
   - Search for specific technical terms found in initial research
   - Look for primary sources (original papers, documentation)

3. **Cross-Reference**
   - Verify claims across multiple independent sources
   - Look for consensus vs. controversy
   - Check for updates/corrections

### Search Query Patterns

**For Technical Topics**:
- `[technology] official documentation`
- `[technology] architecture design`
- `[technology] best practices 2024`
- `[specific feature] implementation details`

**For Comparative Analysis**:
- `[A] vs [B] comparison`
- `[A] [B] benchmark performance`
- `when to use [A] over [B]`

**For Problem-Solving**:
- `[technology] [problem] solution`
- `[error message] fix`
- `[technology] troubleshooting guide`

## Source Evaluation Framework

### Authority Indicators

**High Authority**:
- Official documentation
- Peer-reviewed publications
- Posts by core maintainers/creators
- Standards bodies (IETF, W3C, IEEE)
- .edu, .gov domains

**Medium Authority**:
- Technical blogs from established companies
- Conference presentations
- Technical books from reputable publishers
- Stack Overflow answers (with high votes)

**Low Authority**:
- Personal blogs (unless author is recognized expert)
- Forums without verification
- Social media posts
- Outdated content (>3 years for fast-moving tech)

### Credibility Checks

For each source, assess:
1. **Author Credentials**: Who wrote this? What's their expertise?
2. **Publication Date**: Is this current?
3. **Citation Quality**: Does it cite authoritative sources?
4. **Peer Review**: Has this been vetted?
5. **Conflicts of Interest**: Any bias?

## Information Synthesis

### Building Coherent Narratives

1. **Start with Fundamentals**
   - Define key concepts
   - Establish context
   - Build from first principles

2. **Layer in Complexity**
   - Progress from simple to complex
   - Show relationships between concepts
   - Provide examples at each level

3. **Address Multiple Perspectives**
   - Present consensus views
   - Acknowledge controversies
   - Show evolution of understanding

### Handling Conflicting Information

When sources disagree:

1. **Assess Source Quality**
   - Weight higher-authority sources more heavily
   - Consider recency (newer may be more accurate)
   - Check if one source cites the other

2. **Look for Context**
   - Are they talking about the same thing?
   - Different use cases or constraints?
   - Historical vs. current state?

3. **Present All Perspectives**
   - Don't hide disagreement
   - Explain why sources might differ
   - Indicate which view has more support

## Citation Standards

### What to Cite

**Always cite**:
- Direct quotes
- Specific statistics or data
- Technical claims
- Controversial statements
- Historical facts
- Performance benchmarks

**Citation not always needed**:
- Common knowledge in the field
- Your own analysis/synthesis
- Logical conclusions from cited facts

### Citation Format

**Web Sources**:
```
[Title or Description](URL) - Accessed YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Code Sources**:
```
`file/path/name.ext:123-145`
```

**Academic Papers**:
```
Author et al. (Year). "Title". Journal/Conference. [URL if available] - Accessed YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Citation Density

- At least one citation per major claim
- Multiple citations (3+) for critical/controversial claims
- Cluster citations at ends of paragraphs when possible

## Quality Assurance

### Self-Check Before Finalizing

1. **Completeness**
   - [ ] All aspects of question addressed?
   - [ ] No major knowledge gaps?
   - [ ] Sufficient depth for question complexity?

2. **Accuracy**
   - [ ] All claims properly cited?
   - [ ] No unsourced statistics?
   - [ ] Dates and numbers verified?

3. **Clarity**
   - [ ] Technical terms defined?
   - [ ] Logical flow of information?
   - [ ] Examples provided where helpful?

4. **Balance**
   - [ ] Multiple perspectives shown?
   - [ ] Limitations acknowledged?
   - [ ] Confidence levels indicated?

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Vague claims ("many experts believe...")
- Missing dates on time-sensitive information
- Single source for important claims
- Broken or suspicious URLs
- Outdated information presented as current
- Logical leaps without explanation
- Missing context for statistics

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### Technical Research
- Verify code examples actually work
- Note version numbers for libraries/frameworks
- Distinguish best practices from possible approaches
- Include performance implications

### Academic Research
- Prioritize peer-reviewed over preprints
- Note sample sizes
- Check for retractions
- Understand methodology limitations

### Market/Business Research
- Distinguish disclosed vs. estimated data
- Note data recency
- Verify across multiple sources
- Understand methodology for market sizing

## Research Ethics

### What Not to Do

- Don't plagiarize (always cite sources)
- Don't present opinions as facts
- Don't cherry-pick data to support a narrative
- Don't ignore contradicting information
- Don't claim certainty when uncertain
- Don't use paywalled content without access

### Best Practices

- Be transparent about limitations
- Acknowledge when information is limited
- Show your reasoning process
- Cite generously
- Flag uncertainty clearly
- Update knowledge when new information emerges
