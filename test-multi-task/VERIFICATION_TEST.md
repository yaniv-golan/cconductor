# Verification Test: Fixes Against Actual Session Data

**Session**: session_1759822984807227000
**Goal**: Verify fixes would have prevented the failures

---

## Test Plan

### Test 1: Verify timeout fix would have prevented exit 127
- Check: Coordinator continuation code path
- Method: Code inspection (can't retroactively test runtime)

### Test 2: Verify file-based extraction logic
- Check: New extraction code with actual agent outputs
- Method: Test with web-researcher output (which succeeded)

### Test 3: Simulate file-based output for academic-researcher
- Check: If agent had written files, would extraction work?
- Method: Create mock file-based output, test extraction
