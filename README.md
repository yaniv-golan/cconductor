## Understanding Claude Code Access

CConductor requires Claude Code to function and cannot run with just an Anthropic API key.

### What is Claude Code?

Claude Code allows Claude to run integrated developer workflows from your terminal/IDE. CConductor uses Claude Code's Task tool to orchestrate its multi-agent research system.

### Getting Access

Claude Code is available through:

- **Claude Pro/Max subscriptions** - Includes Claude Code usage within your plan quota
- **API/Pay-as-you-go** - Billed separately per usage when you exceed plan limits

### Understanding Costs

- Your Claude subscription (Pro, Max) includes a quota of Claude Code usage
- Usage beyond your quota falls back to API billing (pay-per-use)
- API and subscription billing are separate systems
- Research sessions typically use multiple prompts (planning, research, synthesis, validation)

### Which Plan Do I Need?

- **Pro Plan** - Suitable for occasional research sessions
- **Max Plan** - Better for frequent or intensive research
- **API Credits** - Available for usage beyond plan limits

**For current pricing and plan details**, see:

- [Anthropic Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing)
- [Using Claude Code with Plans](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan)
- [API Usage Billing](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8977456-how-do-i-pay-for-my-api-usage)

**Note**: Plan features, quotas, and pricing are subject to change. Always verify current details with Anthropic.

### Advanced Options

**Custom install location:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/main/install.sh | bash -s /custom/path
```

**Manual initialization:**

```bash
./cconductor --init              # Interactive mode
./cconductor --init --yes        # Non-interactive (for scripts)
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start new research
./cconductor "your research question"

# View latest results

## Research Modes

CConductor automatically selects the best approach based on your question, or you can configure the default mode in `~/.config/cconductor/cconductor-config.json`.

**Available modes** (defaults in `config/cconductor-modes.default.json`, customize in `~/.config/cconductor/cconductor-modes.json`):

- **default** - Balanced research for general topics
- **scientific** - Academic research with peer-reviewed sources
- **market** - Business and competitive analysis
- **technical** - Technical and architectural deep-dives  
- **literature_review** - Comprehensive academic literature reviews

**Mode selection in v0.1**: Automatic detection based on your question keywords.

**Coming in v0.2**: Explicit mode selection via `--mode` CLI option.

## Executive Summary

Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that leverages
quantum mechanical phenomena‚Äîsuperposition and entanglement‚Äîto process
information [1]. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1),
quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple
states simultaneously [2]...

## Configuration

CConductor is highly configurable without code changes.

### Security Profiles

Control which domains CConductor can access:

**Location**: `~/.config/cconductor/security-config.json` (create with `./src/utils/config-loader.sh init security-config`)

```json
{
  "security_profile": "strict"       // Maximum safety (default)
  // OR
  "security_profile": "permissive"   // Balanced approach
  // OR
  "security_profile": "max_automation" // Testing only (use in VMs)
}
```

**Profiles**:

- **strict** - Academic/sensitive data, prompts for unknown domains
- **permissive** - Business research, fewer prompts, trusted networks
- **max_automation** - Testing/sandboxed only, minimal prompts

See [Security Guide](docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md) for details.

### Custom Knowledge

Teach CConductor about your domain:

**Location**:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/CConductor/knowledge-base-custom/my-domain.md`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/cconductor/knowledge-base-custom/my-domain.md`

```markdown
## Overview
What this knowledge covers.

## Key Concepts
- Term 1: Definition
- Term 2: Definition

## Important Facts
- Fact about your domain
```

CConductor automatically discovers and uses all `.md` files in your custom knowledge directory!

**Tip**: Use `./src/utils/path-resolver.sh resolve knowledge_base_custom` to find your exact path.

See [Custom Knowledge Guide](docs/CUSTOM_KNOWLEDGE.md) for details.

### Research Preferences

**Location**: `~/.config/cconductor/cconductor-config.json` (create with `./src/utils/config-loader.sh init cconductor-config`)

Configure default behavior, agent settings, output preferences, and quality standards.

See [Configuration Reference](docs/CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md) for all options.
