### Quality Gate Enforcement

Every mission finishes with an automated quality gate that reviews each claim for:

- **Evidence coverage** ‚Äì minimum sources and independent domains
- **Source trust** ‚Äì weighted credibility (peer-reviewed, official, etc.)
- **Confidence and recency** ‚Äì claim confidence and time-bound evidence

The gate now defaults to **advisory mode**:

- Reports still complete, but the top of the document shows a ‚ÄúQuality Issues Detected‚Äù banner when thresholds are missed.
- Sessions end with status `completed_with_advisory`, and the full diagnostics live in `artifacts/quality-gate.json` plus a compact summary in `artifacts/quality-gate-summary.json`.
- The orchestrator (or a manual resume) can read those files to follow the remediation checklist and rerun the gate.
- User-facing deliverables live in `report/` (mission report, research journal); supporting diagnostics remain in `artifacts/`.

Switch the config to `mode: "enforce"` if you prefer to block finalization until every threshold is satisfied. All thresholds and mode settings live in `~/.config/cconductor/quality-gate.json`.

---

## Understanding Claude Code Access

CConductor requires Claude Code to function and cannot run with just an Anthropic API key.

### What is Claude Code?

Claude Code allows Claude to run integrated developer workflows from your terminal/IDE. CConductor uses the Claude Code CLI in headless mode with allowed tools to orchestrate its multi-agent research system.

### Getting Access

Claude Code is available through:

- **Claude Pro/Max subscriptions** - Includes Claude Code usage within your plan quota
- **API/Pay-as-you-go** - Billed separately per usage when you exceed plan limits

### Understanding Costs

- Your Claude subscription (Pro, Max) includes a quota of Claude Code usage
- Usage beyond your quota falls back to API billing (pay-per-use)
- API and subscription billing are separate systems
- Research sessions typically use multiple prompts (planning, research, synthesis, validation)

### Which Plan Do I Need?

- **Pro Plan** - Suitable for occasional research sessions
- **Max Plan** - Better for frequent or intensive research
- **API Credits** - Available for usage beyond plan limits

**For current pricing and plan details**, see:

- [Anthropic Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing)
- [Using Claude Code with Plans](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan)
- [API Usage Billing](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8977456-how-do-i-pay-for-my-api-usage)

**Note**: Plan features, quotas, and pricing are subject to change. Always verify current details with Anthropic.

---

### Advanced Options

**Custom install location:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/main/install.sh | bash -s /custom/path
```

**Manual initialization:**

```bash
./cconductor --init              # Interactive mode
./cconductor --init --yes        # Non-interactive (for scripts)
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start new research (auto-launches real-time dashboard)
./cconductor "your research question"

# View latest results
./cconductor sessions latest

# View research dashboard (auto-launched during research)
./cconductor view-dashboard              # Latest session
./cconductor view-dashboard mission_123  # Specific session

# Export research journal as markdown
SESSION_DIR=$(./src/utils/path-resolver.sh resolve session_dir)
bash src/utils/export-journal.sh "$SESSION_DIR/$(cat "$SESSION_DIR/.latest")"

# List all sessions
./cconductor sessions

# Continue previous research
./cconductor resume mission_1759420487

# Check if research is running
./cconductor status

# View configuration
./cconductor configure

# Run/re-run initialization
./cconductor --init

# Show help
./cconductor --help

# Show version
./cconductor --version
```

### Session Outputs & Storage

Every mission writes to a timestamped directory under `research-sessions/mission_<id>/` with an organized session tree (v0.4.0):

- `INDEX.json` ‚Äì Session manifest with file counts, checksums, and quick navigation
- `README.md` ‚Äì "start here" session map with quick links and stats
- `meta/` ‚Äì Session metadata, provenance, budgeting, and orchestrator state
- `inputs/` ‚Äì Original research question and user-provided files
- `cache/` ‚Äì Web/search cache artifacts reused within the mission
- `work/` ‚Äì Agent working directories and intermediate findings
- `knowledge/` ‚Äì Knowledge graph and session knowledge files
- `artifacts/` ‚Äì Agent-produced artifacts with manifest
- `evidence/` ‚Äì Footnotes, bibliographies, and quality gate exports wired into the final report
- `library/` ‚Äì Mission-scoped Library Memory digests for reuse across missions
- `logs/` ‚Äì Events, orchestration decisions, quality gate diagnostics, system errors
- `report/` ‚Äì Final mission report and research journal
- `viewer/` ‚Äì Interactive dashboard (HTML/JS)

**Key Files**:
- `report/mission-report.md` ‚Äì User-facing research report
- `report/research-journal.md` ‚Äì Chronological mission journal
- `knowledge/knowledge-graph.json` ‚Äì Structured knowledge state
- `viewer/index.html` ‚Äì Real-time research dashboard

Two additional storage locations matter for reuse:

- **Platform cache** ‚Äì transient WebFetch/WebSearch assets stored under the OS cache root (`~/Library/Caches/CConductor/` on macOS, `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/cconductor/` on Linux). Clearing it only forces fresh network calls next time.
- **Library** ‚Äì durable digests in the repository's `library/` directory (or `LIBRARY_MEMORY_ROOT`). Populated by `src/utils/digital-librarian.sh` from knowledge-graph citations and reused through the LibraryMemory skill.

### Built-in Skills

- **Cache-Aware Web Research** ‚Äî shared guidance for canonical query reuse, LibraryMemory digests, and deciding when to bypass caches with `?fresh=1`. Copied into each session‚Äôs `.claude/skills/` directory.
- **LibraryMemory** ‚Äî hash, digest, and cached search helpers for reusing previously collected evidence (also copied into `.claude/skills/`).

### Examples

```bash
# Research any topic
./cconductor "What is quantum computing?"

# Academic question
./cconductor "Latest research on mRNA vaccines"

# Business question
./cconductor "AI coding assistant market landscape"

# Technical question
./cconductor "Kubernetes architecture and components"

# Resume to improve quality
./cconductor resume mission_1759420487
```

---

## Research Modes

CConductor automatically selects the best approach based on your question, or you can configure the default mode in `~/.config/cconductor/cconductor-config.json`.

## Executive Summary

Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that leverages
quantum mechanical phenomena‚Äîsuperposition and entanglement‚Äîto process
information [1]. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1),
quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple
states simultaneously [2]...

## Configuration

CConductor is highly configurable without code changes.

### Security Profiles

Control which domains CConductor can access:

**Location**: `~/.config/cconductor/security-config.json` (create with `./src/utils/config-loader.sh init security-config`)

**Default configuration** (`config/security-config.default.json`):
```json
{
  "security_profile": "strict"
}
```

**Available profiles**:
```json
{
  "security_profile": "strict"       // Maximum safety (default)
  // OR
  "security_profile": "permissive"   // Balanced approach
  // OR
  "security_profile": "max_automation" // Testing only (use in VMs)
}
```

**Profiles**:

- **strict** - Academic/sensitive data, prompts for unknown domains
- **permissive** - Business research, fewer prompts, trusted networks
- **max_automation** - Testing/sandboxed only, minimal prompts

See [Security Guide](docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md) for details.

### Custom Knowledge

Teach CConductor about your domain:

**Location**:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/CConductor/knowledge-base-custom/my-domain.md`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/cconductor/knowledge-base-custom/my-domain.md`

**Note**: Capitalization follows platform conventions: macOS uses `CConductor` (Title Case) while Linux/Windows use `cconductor` (lowercase).

```markdown
## Overview
What this knowledge covers.

## Key Concepts
- Term 1: Definition
- Term 2: Definition

## Important Facts
- Fact about your domain
```

CConductor automatically discovers and uses all `.md` files in your custom knowledge directory!

**Tip**: Use `./src/utils/path-resolver.sh resolve knowledge_base_custom` to find your exact path.

See [Custom Knowledge Guide](docs/CUSTOM_KNOWLEDGE.md) for details.

#### User Data (OS-Appropriate, Git-Ignored)

**macOS**:
```
~/Library/Application Support/CConductor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research-sessions/          # Your research output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge-base-custom/      # Your custom knowledge files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ citations.json             # Citation database

~/Library/Caches/CConductor/     # PDF cache and temp files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdfs/                      # Downloaded and processed PDFs

~/Library/Logs/CConductor/      # System logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audit.log                  # Security and usage audit log
```

**Linux** (XDG Base Directory):
```
~/.local/share/cconductor/      # Your research data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research-sessions/         # Research session outputs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge-base-custom/     # Custom knowledge files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ citations.json            # Citation tracking

~/.cache/cconductor/           # Cache directory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdfs/                     # PDF processing cache

~/.local/state/cconductor/     # State and logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audit.log                 # Audit trail
```

**Windows**:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CConductor\     # User data directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research-sessions/        # Research outputs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge-base-custom/    # Custom knowledge
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ citations.json           # Citations

%TEMP%\CConductor\            # Temporary files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cache\                   # PDF and processing cache
```

**Directory Structure Benefits**:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Code, data, and configuration are clearly separated
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with appropriate paths
- **User Isolation**: Each user has their own data and configurations
- **Upgrade Safety**: User data survives project reinstallation
- **Git-Friendly**: Only application code is tracked, user data is ignored
