---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Code CLI access** ‚Äì You need a Claude Pro/Max subscription or API credits plus the Claude Code CLI (run `claude`, then `/status` to confirm your account). Install via the native script (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`) or, if you already have Node.js 18+, `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.
- **Supported platforms** ‚Äì macOS 10.15+, Linux distros with GNU coreutils (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, Fedora 33+), or Windows via WSL2.
- **System packages** ‚Äì Bash ‚â• 4.0, `git`, `jq`, `curl`, `bc`, and `ripgrep`. The quick-start commands below install them for you.
- **Python 3** ‚Äì Used for knowledge graph tooling (pre-installed on most systems).
- **Optional (installed in quick start):** `dialog` for the full interactive TUI experience.

### Quick Start (Non-Technical)
Use the commands for your platform to go from zero to your first mission. Replace `sudo` with your preferred privilege escalation tool if needed.

#### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code CLI and authenticate
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude
# In the Claude prompt (looks like ">"), type:
#   /login    # opens browser-based OAuth flow
# After the browser flow completes, type:
#   /status   # confirms account, version, and connectivity

# 2. Install required system packages
# (Install Homebrew first if you do not already have it: 
#  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)")
brew install bash jq curl bc ripgrep git dialog

# 3. Install CConductor (accept the PATH prompt when offered)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# 4. Launch the guided experience
cconductor
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian / WSL2
```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code CLI and authenticate
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude
# In the Claude prompt (looks like ">"), type:
#   /login
#   /status

# 2. Install required system packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git jq curl bc ripgrep dialog

# 3. Install CConductor (installs to ~/.cconductor by default)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# 4. Launch the guided experience
cconductor
```

> WSL2 users should run the Linux commands inside their WSL distribution. The quick installer does not install the Claude CLI or other system packages, so completing steps 1-2 first is required.

> Prefer a Homebrew-managed install on macOS? Jump to [Option 2: Homebrew (macOS)](#option-2-homebrew-macos) in the Installation Options section.

### Verify Installation
```bash
claude
#   /status          # Confirms CLI version, account, and connectivity
cconductor --help    # Shows available commands (use ./cconductor if running from a cloned repo)
```

### Run Your First Mission
- **Interactive mode:** `cconductor` (or `./cconductor`) launches the dialog-based TUI for guided setup. Install `dialog` for the full menu experience.
- **Direct command:** `cconductor "What is quantum computing?"`
- **Choose a mission type:**
  ```bash
  cconductor "your question" --mission market-research       # Market analysis
  cconductor "your question" --mission academic-research     # Scholarly sources
  cconductor "your question" --mission competitive-analysis  # Competitor research
  cconductor "your question" --mission technical-analysis    # Technical deep-dive
  # Default: general-research (flexible for any topic)
  ```
- **View your results:** `cconductor sessions latest`

On first run, CConductor automatically creates the session workspace and configuration (about five seconds). Research reports live under `research-sessions/` with full citations and quality assessments.

### Platform Notes
- **Supported operating systems:** macOS 10.15+, Linux distributions with GNU coreutils (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, Fedora 33+), and Windows via WSL2.
- **Known limitations:** FreeBSD/OpenBSD use a different `date` implementation that can break timestamp formatting; Windows native shells are not supported‚Äîrun inside WSL2 instead.
- **Time formatting:** All scripts use `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`, which works on macOS (BSD date) and GNU/Linux. Adjust the command if your environment uses a non-standard `date`.

---

### Quality Gate Enforcement

Every mission finishes with an automated quality gate that reviews each claim for:

- **Evidence coverage** ‚Äì minimum sources and independent domains
- **Source trust** ‚Äì weighted credibility (peer-reviewed, official, etc.)
- **Confidence and recency** ‚Äì claim confidence and time-bound evidence

The gate now defaults to **advisory mode**:

- Reports still complete, but the top of the document shows a ‚ÄúQuality Issues Detected‚Äù banner when thresholds are missed.
- Sessions end with status `completed_with_advisory`, and the full diagnostics live in `artifacts/quality-gate.json` plus a compact summary in `artifacts/quality-gate-summary.json`.
- The orchestrator (or a manual resume) can read those files to follow the remediation checklist and rerun the gate.
- User-facing deliverables live in `report/` (mission report, research journal); supporting diagnostics remain in `artifacts/`.

Switch the config to `mode: "enforce"` if you prefer to block finalization until every threshold is satisfied. All thresholds and mode settings live in `~/.config/cconductor/quality-gate.json`.

---

## Installation Options

> Completed the prerequisites above? Pick the workflow that fits your environment and compliance requirements.

### Option 1: Quick Install Script (Recommended for individual laptops)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```
**What it does**
- Clones the latest release into `~/.cconductor` (or a path you pass as the first argument).
- Runs `cconductor --init --yes` to prepare caches, config directories, and quality gates.
- Prompts to add `cconductor` to your `PATH` so you can run it from anywhere.

**Remember:** This script expects the Claude Code CLI and system packages from the quick-start steps to already be installed.

### Option 2: Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew tap yaniv-golan/cconductor
brew install cconductor

# Install Claude Code CLI (native installer recommended)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude
#   /login
#   /status

# Install supporting tools if you skipped the quick start
brew install bash jq curl bc ripgrep git
```
Homebrew installs the CLI into your PATH automatically. Re-run `claude`, then `/status`, along with `cconductor --help` to verify everything is available.

### Option 3: Manual Git Clone (Advanced / Contributors)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor.git
cd cconductor

# Prepare the workspace (non-interactive)
./cconductor --init --yes

# Run from the repo root
./cconductor "your research question"
```
Use this path if you plan to contribute code, track the `main` branch closely, or run from a fork. Add the repository directory to your PATH if you want to call `cconductor` without the leading `./`.

### Option 4: Docker & CI Pipelines
- **Quick start (existing Claude credentials):**
  ```bash
  docker run -v ~/.claude:/root/.claude \
    -v ~/research:/data/research-sessions \
    ghcr.io/yaniv-golan/cconductor:latest \
    "What is quantum computing?"
  ```
- **Using an API key in automation:**
  ```bash
  echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx" > .env
  docker run --env-file .env \
    -v ~/research:/data/research-sessions \
    ghcr.io/yaniv-golan/cconductor:latest \
    "What is quantum computing?"
  ```
- **Production (Docker Swarm example):**
  ```bash
  echo "sk-ant-xxx" | docker secret create anthropic_api_key -
  docker service create \
    --secret anthropic_api_key \
    --mount type=volume,source=research-data,target=/data \
    ghcr.io/yaniv-golan/cconductor:latest
  ```
Review [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) for extended configuration, health checks, and volume layouts.

### Offline or Pinned Version Install
```bash
# Download installer and checksum
curl -LO https://github.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/releases/latest/download/install.sh
curl -LO https://github.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/releases/latest/download/install.sh.sha256

# Verify integrity
sha256sum -c install.sh.sha256

# Install (defaults to ~/.cconductor)
bash install.sh
```
To install a specific release, export `CCONDUCTOR_VERSION` or download the pinned installer:
```bash
export CCONDUCTOR_VERSION=v0.3.1
curl -fsSL https://github.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/releases/download/${CCONDUCTOR_VERSION}/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Upgrade & Maintenance

- **Quick install / manual clone:** `git -C ~/.cconductor pull` (replace the path if you chose a custom install directory). Run `cconductor --init --yes` after pulling if new migrations are introduced.
- **Homebrew:** `brew upgrade cconductor`
- **Docker:** `docker pull ghcr.io/yaniv-golan/cconductor:latest`
- **Pinned version:** rerun the installer with the desired `CCONDUCTOR_VERSION`.

Built-in commands:
```bash
cconductor --update          # Manually fetch the latest release metadata
cconductor --check-update    # Check if an update is available
cconductor --no-update-check "your question"  # Skip the automatic update probe for a single run
```
To disable background update checks entirely, edit `~/.config/cconductor/cconductor-config.json`:
```json
{
  "update_settings": {
    "check_for_updates": false
  }
}
```

## Understanding Claude Code Access

CConductor requires Claude Code to function and cannot run with just an Anthropic API key.

### What is Claude Code?

Claude Code allows Claude to run integrated developer workflows from your terminal/IDE. CConductor uses the Claude Code CLI in headless mode with allowed tools to orchestrate its multi-agent research system.

### Getting Access

Claude Code is available through:

- **Claude Pro/Max subscriptions** - Includes Claude Code usage within your plan quota
- **API/Pay-as-you-go** - Billed separately per usage when you exceed plan limits

### Understanding Costs

- Your Claude subscription (Pro, Max) includes a quota of Claude Code usage
- Usage beyond your quota falls back to API billing (pay-per-use)
- API and subscription billing are separate systems
- Research sessions typically use multiple prompts (planning, research, synthesis, validation)

### Which Plan Do I Need?

- **Pro Plan** - Suitable for occasional research sessions
- **Max Plan** - Better for frequent or intensive research
- **API Credits** - Available for usage beyond plan limits

**For current pricing and plan details**, see:

- [Anthropic Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing)
- [Using Claude Code with Plans](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan)
- [API Usage Billing](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8977456-how-do-i-pay-for-my-api-usage)

**Note**: Plan features, quotas, and pricing are subject to change. Always verify current details with Anthropic.

---

### Advanced Options

**Custom install location:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaniv-golan/cconductor/main/install.sh | bash -s /custom/path
```

**Manual initialization:**

```bash
./cconductor --init              # Interactive mode
./cconductor --init --yes        # Non-interactive (for scripts)
```

---

## Usage

> Use `cconductor` (or `./cconductor` if you are running directly from a cloned repository without updating `PATH`).

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start new research (auto-launches real-time dashboard)
cconductor "your research question"

# View latest results
cconductor sessions latest

# View research dashboard (auto-launched during research)
cconductor view-dashboard              # Latest session
cconductor view-dashboard mission_123  # Specific session

# Export research journal as markdown
SESSION_DIR=$(./src/utils/path-resolver.sh resolve session_dir)
bash src/utils/export-journal.sh "$SESSION_DIR/$(cat "$SESSION_DIR/.latest")"

# List all sessions
cconductor sessions

# Continue previous research
cconductor resume mission_1759420487

# Check if research is running
cconductor status

# View configuration
cconductor configure

# Run/re-run initialization
cconductor --init

# Show help
cconductor --help

# Show version
cconductor --version
```

### Session Outputs & Storage

Every mission writes to a timestamped directory under `research-sessions/mission_<id>/` with an organized session tree (v0.4.0):

- `INDEX.json` ‚Äì Session manifest with file counts, checksums, and quick navigation
- `README.md` ‚Äì "start here" session map with quick links and stats
- `meta/` ‚Äì Session metadata, provenance, budgeting, and orchestrator state
- `inputs/` ‚Äì Original research question and user-provided files
- `cache/` ‚Äì Web/search cache artifacts reused within the mission
- `work/` ‚Äì Agent working directories and intermediate findings
- `knowledge/` ‚Äì Knowledge graph and session knowledge files
- `artifacts/` ‚Äì Agent-produced artifacts with manifest
- `evidence/` ‚Äì Footnotes, bibliographies, and quality gate exports wired into the final report
- `library/` ‚Äì Mission-scoped Library Memory digests for reuse across missions
- `logs/` ‚Äì Events, orchestration decisions, quality gate diagnostics, system errors
- `report/` ‚Äì Final mission report and research journal
- `viewer/` ‚Äì Interactive dashboard (HTML/JS)

**Key Files**:
- `report/mission-report.md` ‚Äì User-facing research report
- `report/research-journal.md` ‚Äì Chronological mission journal
- `knowledge/knowledge-graph.json` ‚Äì Structured knowledge state
- `viewer/index.html` ‚Äì Real-time research dashboard

Two additional storage locations matter for reuse:

- **Platform cache** ‚Äì transient WebFetch/WebSearch assets stored under the OS cache root (`~/Library/Caches/CConductor/` on macOS, `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/cconductor/` on Linux). Clearing it only forces fresh network calls next time.
- **Library** ‚Äì durable digests in the repository's `library/` directory (or `LIBRARY_MEMORY_ROOT`). Populated by `src/utils/digital-librarian.sh` from knowledge-graph citations and reused through the LibraryMemory skill.

### Built-in Skills

- **Cache-Aware Web Research** ‚Äî shared guidance for canonical query reuse, LibraryMemory digests, and deciding when to bypass caches with `?fresh=1`. Copied into each session‚Äôs `.claude/skills/` directory.
- **LibraryMemory** ‚Äî hash, digest, and cached search helpers for reusing previously collected evidence (also copied into `.claude/skills/`).

### Examples

```bash
# Research any topic
./cconductor "What is quantum computing?"

# Academic question
./cconductor "Latest research on mRNA vaccines"

# Business question
./cconductor "AI coding assistant market landscape"

# Technical question
./cconductor "Kubernetes architecture and components"

# Resume to improve quality
./cconductor resume mission_1759420487
```

---

## Research Modes

CConductor automatically selects the best approach based on your question, or you can configure the default mode in `~/.config/cconductor/cconductor-config.json`.

## Executive Summary

Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that leverages
quantum mechanical phenomena‚Äîsuperposition and entanglement‚Äîto process
information [1]. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1),
quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple
states simultaneously [2]...

## Configuration

CConductor is highly configurable without code changes.

### Security Profiles

Control which domains CConductor can access:

**Location**: `~/.config/cconductor/security-config.json` (create with `./src/utils/config-loader.sh init security-config`)

**Default configuration** (`config/security-config.default.json`):
```json
{
  "security_profile": "strict"
}
```

**Available profiles**:
```json
{
  "security_profile": "strict"       // Maximum safety (default)
  // OR
  "security_profile": "permissive"   // Balanced approach
  // OR
  "security_profile": "max_automation" // Testing only (use in VMs)
}
```

**Profiles**:

- **strict** - Academic/sensitive data, prompts for unknown domains
- **permissive** - Business research, fewer prompts, trusted networks
- **max_automation** - Testing/sandboxed only, minimal prompts

See [Security Guide](docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md) for details.

### Custom Knowledge

Teach CConductor about your domain:

**Location**:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/CConductor/knowledge-base-custom/my-domain.md`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/cconductor/knowledge-base-custom/my-domain.md`

**Note**: Capitalization follows platform conventions: macOS uses `CConductor` (Title Case) while Linux/Windows use `cconductor` (lowercase).

```markdown
## Overview
What this knowledge covers.

## Key Concepts
- Term 1: Definition
- Term 2: Definition

## Important Facts
- Fact about your domain
```

CConductor automatically discovers and uses all `.md` files in your custom knowledge directory!

**Tip**: Use `./src/utils/path-resolver.sh resolve knowledge_base_custom` to find your exact path.

See [Custom Knowledge Guide](docs/CUSTOM_KNOWLEDGE.md) for details.

### Research Preferences

**Location**: `~/.config/cconductor/cconductor-config.json` (create with `./src/utils/config-loader.sh init cconductor-config`)

#### User Data (OS-Appropriate, Git-Ignored)

**macOS**:
```
~/Library/Application Support/CConductor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research-sessions/          # Your research output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge-base-custom/      # Your custom knowledge files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ citations.json             # Citation database

~/Library/Caches/CConductor/     # PDF cache and temp files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdfs/                      # Downloaded and processed PDFs

~/Library/Logs/CConductor/      # System logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audit.log                  # Security and usage audit log
```

**Linux** (XDG Base Directory):
```
~/.local/share/cconductor/      # Your research data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research-sessions/         # Research session outputs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge-base-custom/     # Custom knowledge files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ citations.json            # Citation tracking

~/.cache/cconductor/           # Cache directory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdfs/                     # PDF processing cache

~/.local/state/cconductor/     # State and logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audit.log                 # Audit trail
```

**Windows**:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CConductor\     # User data directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research-sessions/        # Research outputs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge-base-custom/    # Custom knowledge
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ citations.json           # Citations

%TEMP%\CConductor\            # Temporary files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cache\                   # PDF and processing cache
```

**Directory Structure Benefits**:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Code, data, and configuration are clearly separated
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with appropriate paths
- **User Isolation**: Each user has their own data and configurations
- **Upgrade Safety**: User data survives project reinstallation
- **Git-Friendly**: Only application code is tracked, user data is ignored
